HomeTask 1
------------------
In Problem 1, I initiated the process by defining the diameters of both the Earth and the Sun in miles. Subsequently, I computed their radii by dividing the diameters by 2. Employing the volume formula for spheres, I calculated the volumes of both celestial bodies. Finally, I determined the ratio of the Sun's volume to that of the Earth and presented the results.

In Problem 2, I implemented a labeled 'continue' statement with the label 'outer' to facilitate the skipping of iterations within the outer loop when a divisor was identified for the current 'i' value. I discarded the 'isPrime' variable, making it redundant. The prime-checking loop was optimized to examine divisors only up to the square root of the number in question. This optimization enhanced efficiency, as factors exceeding the square root must have corresponding factors smaller than the square root, which had already been scrutinized.

In Problem 3, I meticulously examined the characters within the provided text to tally the occurrences of spaces, vowels, and consonants. Employing a 'for-each' loop, each character in the text string was scrutinized. The 'Character.isWhitespace(ch)' method was employed to ascertain if a character constituted a space. Additionally, I checked if a character was a letter through 'Character.isLetter(ch)', incrementing the letter count while simultaneously evaluating if it qualified as a vowel (specifically, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u') while disregarding case sensitivity. Subsequently, I reported the counts of vowels, consonants, and spaces.

In Problem 4, I took the provided soliloquy and segmented it into individual words by applying regular expressions to delineate spaces, commas, semicolons, and backticks as word delimiters. Subsequently, I employed the bubble sort algorithm to organize these words in alphabetical order. The bubble sort method entailed scrutinizing adjacent words and swapping them if they were found to be out of sequence, with this process continuing until no further swaps were necessary. Finally, I outputted the sorted words in ascending alphabetical order.
