In Problem1:
--------------

We first define the diameters of the Earth and the Sun in miles.
Then, we calculate the radii by dividing the diameters by 2.
Next, we use the volume formula for spheres to calculate the volumes of the Earth and the Sun.
Finally, we calculate the ratio of the Sun's volume to the Earth's volume and print all the results.


In Problem2:
--------------

we use the labeled continue statement with the label 'outer' to skip to the next iteration of the outer loop when a divisor is found for the current 'i' value.
We eliminate the isPrime variable as it's no longer needed.
We optimize the prime-checking loop by only testing divisors up to the square root of the number being checked. This is more efficient because any factors larger than the square root must have corresponding factors smaller than the square root, which have already been checked.

In Problem3:
--------------

It analyzes the characters in the given text to count the number of spaces, vowels, and consonants.
It uses a for-each loop to iterate through each character in the text string.
The Character.isWhitespace(ch) method is used to check if a character is a space.
The code checks if a character is a letter using Character.isLetter(ch), and if it's a letter, it counts it and checks if it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) while ignoring case.
Finally, it prints the counts of vowels, consonants, and spaces in the text.

In Problem 4:
--------------

The program takes the soliloquy and splits it into words using regular expressions to account for spaces, commas, semicolons, and backticks as word separators.
It then uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the words in alphabetical order. Bubble sort compares adjacent words and swaps them if they are out of order, repeating this process until no more swaps are needed.
Finally, it prints the sorted words in alphabetical order.
